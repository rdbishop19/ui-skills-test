# EDGE CASE - SPARK UI SKILLS TEST

# INTRO:

Welcome to the Auction Edge Spark Dev Team skills interview test. First off, we want you to feel as comfortbale as possible in this process so just know, regardless of which feature you choose to build, you are not required to finish.

You will be pairing with one of our dev team members through the entire skills test. This team member will be available for you to ask for help as needed. They will also be available for questions about the test and to guide you through the test process.

# THINGS TO CONSIDER:

Here you are given a new React App that has some of the basic functionality already installed and written. You will also find some utility functions at your disposal within the app. You are more than welcome to use these on either of the features you choose to build.

Our app utilizes Material-UI at its core. So we want you to use Material-UI components within whichever feature you choose to build out.
