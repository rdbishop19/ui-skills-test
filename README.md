Have you asked questions yet?

Lastly, regardless of which feature you choose to build, **your goal should not be worrying about finishing**. :relieved:

## OVERVIEW

We have provided you a basic [React App](https://reactjs.org/) that has some of the functionality and components already written.

## DIRECTIONS

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/rdbishop19/ui-skills-test`
1. `cd` into your local copy
1. Run `npm` commands to install and start the app

#### (SOME BACKGROUND)
*Our app [Spark](https://www.auctionedge.com/spark) utilizes [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) at its core. We leverage their component API and extensive documentation to help us deliver quality UI code on the daily.*

# FEATURES (PICK ONE)

## #1 - THE LIST :white_check_mark:

#### FOOTNOTE
  Our only goal is help you experience a "day in the life" on the Auction Edge team.
  In doing that, we hope to also get a glimpse into who you are, how you tackle problems and work with others, and where you are in your development journey.
  So have fun with it, nerd out with us, and if you're possibly reading this *after* the interview, don't spend *too* much time thinking how you could've done it differently. You did just fine. :muscle:
